Scorpiov Wildcard File Validator

Scans every .txt file under wildcards/ (recursively, same as the node
itself) and flags lines with problems that would cause the resolver to
silently produce garbled/blended output instead of a clean pick -- most
importantly, unbalanced { } braces from an inline {a|b|c} group that
never got its closing brace.

USAGE:
    python validate_wildcards.py                  # looks for ./wildcards
    python validate_wildcards.py /path/to/wildcards

This is a standalone read-only check -- it never modifies your files.

NOTE: comment-stripping logic here is intentionally kept in sync with
_strip_comments_from_lines() in scorpiov_wildcard.py. If that function's
comment rules ever change, update this copy to match, or a comment
containing a stray { or } could produce a false positive/negative here.
